# Tree-based variational inference for Poisson log-normal models
>
> Hierarchical organization of entities, such as taxonomies in microbiology, provide crucial insights into ecosystems but are often ignored by current count-data models. To fill that gap, we propose the PLN-Tree model, an extension of the PLN model designed to incorporate hierarchical structures into count data analysis. The experiments conducted in this work with synthetic and microbiome data emphasize the value of integrating hierarchical organization of entities through PLN-Tree for count data modeling.
> 
> In its current form, PLN-Tree can be used for data augmentation tasks, preprocessing of compositional data (like CLR, ALR, ILR transforms), or to unveil interaction graphs of entities along their hierarchy.
